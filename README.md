# Skyler's Portfolio
Personal Portfolio

This portfolio contains projects I feel are advanced enough to showcase. 

## Arena Fighters
A game I made from scratch using the game engine Godot and its native language GDScript, which is very similar to Python. It features a very simple gameplay loop of running from monsters while your character automatically
makes attacks against them. Collect XP from the slain monsters to get upgrades during and after the game. It can be downloaded here: https://skyler-chiavario.itch.io/arena-fighter
