# Skyler's Portfolio
Personal Portfolio

This portfolio contains projects I feel are advanced enough to showcase. 

## Deep Learning Chatbot
This is a chatbot I helped create along with a fellow peer that uses deep learning to create simple chatbot functionality that could be useful in a business setting. It uses the (X) dataset in order to run.

## Federated Learning with Hospital Data
This project was aimed at creating a federated learning enviroment for hospital data for secruity and privacy. This was also developed alongside a peer and later had its report modified and submitted to a conference. It uses the (X) dataset in order to run.

## Arena Fighters
A game I made from scratch using the game engine Godot and its native language GDScript, which is very similar to Python. It features a very simple gameplay loop of running from monsters while your character automatically
makes attacks against them. Collect XP from the slain monsters to get upgrades during and after the game. It can be downloaded here: https://skyler-chiavario.itch.io/arena-fighter
